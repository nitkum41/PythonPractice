Sets¶
A set is a set of characters inside a pair of square brackets [] with a special meaning. Append multiple conditions back-to back, e.g. [aA-Z].
A ^ (caret) inside a set negates the expression.
A - (dash) in a set specifies a range if it is in between, otherwise the dash itself.

Examples:
- [arn] Returns a match where one of the specified characters (a, r, or n) are present
- [a-n] Returns a match for any lower case character, alphabetically between a and n
- [^arn] Returns a match for any character EXCEPT a, r, and n
- [0123] Returns a match where any of the specified digits (0, 1, 2, or 3) are present
- [0-9] Returns a match for any digit between 0 and 9
- [0-5][0-9] Returns a match for any two-digit numbers from 00 and 59
- [a-zA-Z] Returns a match for any character alphabetically between a and z, lower case OR upper case
